Weather Prediction Dataset
A dataset for teaching machine learning and deep leaerning
Hands-on teaching of modern machine learning and deep learning techniques heavily relies on the use of well-suited datasets.
The "weather prediction dataset" is a novel tabular dataset that was specifically created for teaching machine learning and deep learning to an academic audience.
The dataset contains intuitively accessible weather observations from 18 locations in Europe. It was designed to be suitable for a large variety of different training goals, many of which are not easily giving way to unrealistically high prediction accuracy. Teachers or instructors thus can chose the difficulty of the training goals and thereby match it with the respective learner audience or lesson objective.
The compact size and complexity of the dataset make it possible to quickly train common machine learning and deep learning models on a standard laptop so that they can be used in live hands-on sessions.
